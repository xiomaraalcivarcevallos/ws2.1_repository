# Flip Analysis - Systems Engineering Approach

## Introduction
Educational project applying systems engineering principles 
to analyze aerial flip movement.

## Project Status
🚧 **Initial research phase** - Documentation in development

## Objectives
- Apply systems engineering methodology to human movement
- Decompose the flip into phases and subsystems
- Analyze physical principles involved

## Current Content
- Preliminary phase analysis (takeoff, flight, landing)
- Angular momentum principles

## Next Steps
- [ ] Detailed requirements analysis
- [ ] Phase diagrams
- [ ] Body subsystems analysis
- [ ] Risk documentation
