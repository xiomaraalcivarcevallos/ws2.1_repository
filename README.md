# Flip Analysis - Systems Engineering Approach

## 📋 Introduction

This project demonstrates how **systems engineering principles** can be applied to understand complex physical movements. Using a human aerial flip as a case study, we break down what seems like a simple athletic maneuver into identifiable requirements, phases, and integrated subsystems.

## 🎯 Purpose

To show how engineering methodology—typically used for designing complex machines and products—can systematically analyze and optimize human biomechanical motion.

## 🔧 Systems Engineering Framework

The analysis follows a structured approach:

1. **Requirements Definition**: What needs to be achieved (complete 360° rotation, land safely)
2. **System Decomposition**: Identify key components and their functions
3. **Phasing**: Break execution into distinct operational stages
4. **Integration**: Coordinate all subsystems to work together
5. **Risk Analysis**: Identify potential failures and safety measures

## 📐 Core Engineering Principle

The flip operates on **conservation of angular momentum**: 

- Total spin remains constant once airborne
- Changing body position (compact vs extended) controls rotation speed
- Smaller body shape = faster spin | Larger body shape = slower spin

## 🚀 Why This Approach

By applying systems engineering thinking, we transform an intuitive physical skill into a **documented, repeatable, and teachable process** with clear requirements, phases, and success criteria.

**Methodology**: Treating human movement as an engineered system with inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback loops.
